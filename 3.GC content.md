# 3. G-C content (guanine-cytosine content)

---
GC-content is the percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA or RNA molecule that are either guanine or cytosine. GC-content percentage is calculated by counting the number of Gs and Cs and dividing by the total number of nucleotides.

```
                   GC = Count(G + C)/Count(A + T + G + C) * 100%.
```
