# 1. ORF length(Open reading frame)

---

open reading frames are defined as spans of DNA sequence between the start and stop codons.

----
**Note :**
  - One common use of open reading frames (ORFs) is as one piece of evidence to assist in gene prediction. Long ORFs are often used, along with other evidence, to initially identify candidate protein-coding regions or functional RNA-coding regions in a DNA sequence.
  - Some short ORFs (sORFs), also named Small open reading frames that lack the classical hallmarks of protein-coding genes (both from ncRNAs and mRNAs) can produce functional peptides.
-----
### Tools:
scikit-learn,TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras

----

# Code :
```
from sklearn.sequence_analysis import calculate_orf_length

orf_length = calculate_orf_length(sequence)
```
