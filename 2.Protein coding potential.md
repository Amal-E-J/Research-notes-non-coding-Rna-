 
# 2. Protein coding potential


Protein coding potential is the probability that a transcript or RNA molecule will be translated into a functional protein.

This is usually determined by analyzing features of the transcript sequence, such as open reading frames, sequence conservation, and other features. Protein coding potential can be assessed using a variety of methods, such as support vector machine-based classifiers , evolutionary modeling, and deep learning algorithms.

### Install HMMER
```
  apt install hmmer                # Linux (Ubuntu, Debian...)

```
```
 conda install -c bioconda hmmer  # Anaconda

```

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to determine whether a given RNA is coding or non-coding. By sequencing the RNA, it is possible to identify the open reading frames (ORFs) of the transcript, which can then be used to infer the likelihood of the transcript coding for a protein. Additionally, evolutionary conservation, codon usage, and other factors can be taken into account to further assess the protein coding potential of a given transcript.

# pyhammer

### installation
```
pip install --user pyhmmer
```
```
conda install -c bioconda pyhmmer
```

## Code with pyhammer
```
from pyhammer.predictors.protein_coding_potential import ProteinCodingPotential

# Create a sequence object from a string
from pyhammer.seqio import Sequence
sequence = Sequence('ATGGCATATCCATAG')

# Create a predictor object
predictor = ProteinCodingPotential()

# Predict the protein coding potential
prediction = predictor.predict(sequence)

# Print the prediction
print('Protein coding potential:', prediction)

```
